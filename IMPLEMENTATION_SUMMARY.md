# Modular Question Paper Implementation - Summary

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Feature:** Modular Architecture for Large Question Papers  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Deployed

---

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a modular architecture for managing large question papers (30+ questions) in the XII Commerce application. This improves maintainability, collaboration, and version control.

## 📊 What Was Done

### 1. **Restructured Accountancy Sample Paper 2025-26**

Split the 34-question paper into manageable batch files:

| File | Questions | Marks | Description |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `sample-paper-2025.ts` | 1-16 | 1 mark | Main file with MCQs + imports |
| `sample-paper-2025-q17-20.ts` | 17-20 + OR | 3 marks | Short answer questions |
| `sample-paper-2025-q21-22.ts` | 21-22 | 4 marks | Long answer questions |
| `sample-paper-2025-q23-26.ts` | 23-26 | 6 marks | Very long answer questions |
| `sample-paper-2025-q27-34.ts` | 27-34 + OR | 1-6 marks | Part B (Financial Analysis) |

**Total:** 34 main questions + 10 OR options = 44 question variants

## 📁 File Structure

```
data/accountancy/
├── sample-paper-2025.ts              # Main file (Q1-16 + imports)
├── sample-paper-2025-q17-20.ts       # 3-mark questions batch
├── sample-paper-2025-q21-22.ts       # 4-mark questions batch
├── sample-paper-2025-q23-26.ts       # 6-mark questions batch
└── sample-paper-2025-q27-34.ts       # Part B questions batch
```

### Main File Pattern:
```typescript
import { questions17to20 } from './sample-paper-2025-q17-20';
// ... other imports

export const accountancySamplePaper2025: QuestionPaper = {
  name: 'CBSE Sample Paper 2025-26',
  questions: [
    // Q1-16 inline
    { id: '1', marks: 1, ... },
    // ...
    
    // Q17-34 from batch files
    ...questions17to20,
    ...questions21to22,
    ...questions23to26,
    ...questions27to34
  ]
};
```

### Batch File Pattern:
```typescript
import { Question } from '../../types';
import React from 'react';

export const questions17to20: Question[] = [
  { id: '17', marks: 3, question: ..., solution: ..., explanation: ... },
  // ...
];
```
