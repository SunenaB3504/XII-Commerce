counts in recovery) 
 
Step 1: 
Duration = 4 minutes = 240 seconds 
Sum of pulse = 58 + 50 + 42 = 150 beats 
 
Step 2: 
Fitness Index = (240 × 100) ÷ (2 × 150) = 24000/300 = 80

Q23. Write a short note on Self Talk.  
Sports  psychology  is a  field  that  studies  how  psychological  factors  influence 
athletic   performance   and   participation   in   sports,   exercise,   and   physical 
activity. It examines the mental aspects of sports, including motivation, anxiety, 
stress, and the impact of sports on well-being.  
Key Areas of Focus: 
• Performance Enhancement: 
Sports   psychologists   help   athletes   improve   their   performance   by   using 
psychological  techniques  like  goal  setting,  visualization,  relaxation,  and  self-
talk.  
• Mental Health and Well-being: 
They  also  address  the  impact  of  sports  on  an  individual's  mental  health, 
including issues like burnout, anxiety, and depression.  
• Team Dynamics: 
Sports psychology can also help improve team dynamics and communication, 
fostering a more positive and collaborative environment.  
• Coaching and Training:

Q28.  Discuss the importance of pre, during and post competition diet in detail.  
 
Pre-Competition Diet 
o Provides energy, prevents early fatigue, and ensures smooth digestion 
before performance. 
o Consume high-carbohydrate foods like rice, pasta, or bread for 
sustained energy. 
o Prefer easily digestible, low-fat, and non-fried meals taken 3–4 hours 
before the event. 
 
During Competition Diet 
o Maintains hydration, energy, and electrolyte balance to avoid fatigue 
and muscle cramps. 
o Sip on glucose-rich drinks or electrolyte solutions to maintain blood 
sugar and sodium levels. 
o Include small portions of quick energy foods like banana or energy 
gels if needed. 
 
Post-Competition Diet 
o Supports recovery by replenishing lost fluids and restoring glycogen 
levels in muscles. 
o Eat carbohydrate-rich foods such as fruits, sandwiches, or energy bars 
immediately after. 
o Rehydrate with fluids like water, juice, or sports drinks to replace lost 
electrolytes.

benefits and contraindications of an asana beneficial for the patient of asthma.  
 
Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition where the airways become inflamed 
and narrow, leading to difficulty in breathing. It often triggers coughing, 
wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. 
 
Symptoms of Asthma: 
● Difficulty in breathing 
● Wheezing (whistling sound while breathing) 
● Tightness in chest 
● Frequent coughing, especially at night or early morning 
[1+2+2]

3. Lift the chest upward while arching the back and tilt the head backward so 
that the crown touches the floor. 
4. Hold the posture while breathing deeply and slowly. 
5. Return to the starting position gently. 
 
Benefits: 
❖ Expands the chest and improves lung capacity. 
❖ Helps ease respiratory issues like asthma and bronchitis. 
❖ Stimulates the throat and opens nasal passages for easier breathing. 
❖ Strengthens the upper back and neck muscles. 
❖ Reduces anxiety and stress, which can trigger asthma. 
 
Contraindications:

Procedure: A thorough warm up should be given, including some practice 
starts and accelerations. Start from a stationary position, with one foot in front 
of the other. The front foot must be on or behind the starting line. This starting 
position should be static (dead start). The tester should provide hints for 
maximizing speed (such as keeping low, driving hard with the arms and legs) 
and encouraged to continue running hard through the finish line. 
Scoring: Time taken for completion

ABDOMINAL (PARTIAL CURL-UP) 
Procedure: The subject lies on a cushioned, flat, clean surface with knees 
flexed, usually at 90 degrees, with hands straight on the sides (palms facing 
downwards) closer to the ground, parallel to the body. The subject raises the 
trunk in a smooth motion, keeping the arms in position, curling up the desired 
amount (at least 6 inches above/along the ground towards the parallel strip). 
The trunk is lowered back to the floor so that the shoulder blades or upper 
back touch the floor. 
 
Scoring: Record the maximum number of Curl ups in a certain time period (30 
seconds).
