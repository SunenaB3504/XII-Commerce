31.       Encryption is a way to protect data by scrambling it into a code that can only be unlocked with a                           3
          unique key. It's a vital component of cybersecurity and data privacy protection, and is used to keep
          sensitive information out of the hands of unauthorized users.
          Encryption can be used to protect data in a number of ways, including:
               •    At rest: Protecting data on computers or in the cloud
               •    In transit: Protecting data while it's being sent between computers
               •    While being processed: Protecting data while it's being processed
32.       1.System failure                                                                                                            3
          The system may crash due to hardware failure, which can disrupt work.                          This is especially
          true if there is no backup.
          2.High cost of training
          New versions of hardware and software require training for staff, which can be costly.
          3.Security risks
          Computerized accounting systems store sensitive financial data, which can be vulnerable to
          cyber-attacks, data breaches, and theft.

          Step – 1: Enter data in a worksheet with proper column and row titles.
          Step – 2: Create a basic chart using the pattern from the panel available on top of worksheet
          in Chart groups’ option.
          Step – 3: Change the layout or style of chart. Apply a predefined chart layout. Apply a
          predefined chart style. Change the layout of chart elements. Change the format of chart
          elements.
          Step – 4: Add or remove titles or data labels. Add (Remove) a chart title. Add (Remove)
          axis titles. Link a title to a worksheet cell. Add (Remove) data labels.
          Step – 5: Show or hide a legend.
          Step – 6: Display or hide chart axes or gridlines. Display (hide) primary axes Display (hide)
          secondary axes Display (hide) gridlines
          Step – 7: Move (resize) a chart
          Step – 8: Save a chart

                                                                                 OR

34.       Merging a range of Cells:                                                                                                   6

          Merged cells are a single cell that is created by combining two or more selected cells. The
          cell reference for a merged cell is the upper-left cell in the original selected range. When
          two or more adjacent horizontal or vertical cells are merged, the cells become one large cell
          and displayed across multiple columns or rows. The contents of one appear in the centre of
          the merged cell.

          Steps:

                                                              Page 10 of 11



                        1.  Select two or more adjacent cells that we want to merge.
                        2.  On the Home tab, in the Alignment group, click Merge and Centre.

         Steps to split a merged cell:

         1. Select the merged cell.
         2. When we select a merged cell, the Merge and Centre button also appears selected in the
         Alignment group on the Home tab.
         3. To split the merged cell, click Merge and Centre. The contents of the merged cell will
         appear in the upper-left cell of the range of split cells.
