Learning Objectives
In the pr evious chapter , we have lear ned about
the spreadsheet and its several features that can
be used in business applications. In this chapter ,
we shall discuss the applications of spreadsheet
(using Excel) to Payroll Accounting and some other
select applications (Asset Management, and Loan
Repayment).
3.1 PAYROLL ACCOUNTING
Every employee is paid salary on a pre-determined
date within the framework of employee contract
and related personnel policy in force from time to
time in an organisation.
The computation of salary payment is based
on the number of days an employee has worked,
rate per grade of pay, rate of applied allowances
and deductions to be made therefrom.
The preparation of salary bill should provide
for the following :
• Maintaining payroll related data such as
Employee No., Name, Attendance, Basic Pay,
applicable Dearness and other Allowances,
deductions to be made.
• Periodic payroll computations: the payroll
computation includes the calculation of various
earning and deduction heads, which are to be
derived from basic values (such as basic salary,
number of days under leave without pay (LWP)
and unauthorised absence, etc) as per the
formulae.

• Preparation of salary statement and employees salary slips
• Generation of advice to bank: It contains the net salary to be
transferred to individual bank account of employees and other salary
related statutory payments such as provident fund, tax, etc.
3.1.1 PAYROLL COMPONENTS
Every employee is under contractual relationship of service with an
organisation, and is paid salary accordingly. The following elements
are important for salary computation and its payment:
• CURRENT PAYROLL PERIOD (MONTH AND YEAR)
• EARNINGS
/square4Basic Pay (BP)  : It is the pay in the pay scale plus Grade Pay,
but does not include Special Pay.
/square4Grade Pay (GP)  : It is the pay to be added to the Basic Pay
according to the Designation of the employee and applicable pay
band or scale of pay.
/square4Dearness Pay (DP)  : It is that portion of Dearness Allowance,
which has been declared and deemed to have been merged with
the Basic Pay.
/square4Dearness Allowance (DA)  : It is a compensation for erosion in
the purchasing power of wage earner due to price rise. It is granted
by the Government periodically as a percentage of (Basic Pay +
Dearness Pay, if applicable).
/square4House Rent Allowance (HRA)  : It is an amount paid to facilitate
employee in acquiring on lease of residential accommodation.
/square4Transport Allowance (TRA) : It is an amount to facilitate commuting
to the the place of work, i.e. Delhi, Bhopal, Haridwar , etc.
/square4Any Other Earning  : It may include any other allowance not
included above but declared from time to time, such as Education
Allowance, Medical Allowance, W ashing Allowance, etc.
• DEDUCTIONS
/square4Professional Tax (Applicable in some states) (PT)  : It is a
statutory deduction according to the legislature of the State
Government.
/square4Provident Fund (PF) : It is a statutory deduction, as part of
social security. It is decided by the Government under the
Provident Fund Act and is computed as a percentage of (Basic
Pay + Dearness Pay, if applicable).
/square4Tax Deduction at Source (TDS)  : It is a statutory deduction,
which is deducted monthly towards Income Tax liability of an
employee. It is essentially an apportionment of yearly Income
Tax liability over 12 months.

/square4Recovery of Loan Instalment (LOAN)  : Any amount signified by
the employee for deduction on account of any loan taken up by
him/her.
/square4Any Other Deduction  : It may include any other deduction not
included above such as Recovery of “Advance against Salary”,
deductions on account of “Food Grain Advance”, “Festival
Advance”, etc.
3.1.2 ELEMENTS USED IN PAYROLL CALCULATION
Basic Pay Earned (BPE)  – Basic Pay Earned of an employee is the
Basic Pay calculated with reference to Number of Effective Days present
(NOEDP) during the month.
BPE = BP * NOEDP/NODM
Dearness Allowance (DA) –
DA = BPE *  (Applicable Rate of DA for the Month)
House Rent Allowance (HRA) –
HRA = BPE *  (Applicable Rate of HRA for the Month)
Transport Allowance (TRA) –
TRA = (Fixed Amount) or (On Percentage Basis)
Total Earnings (TE) –  It is the aggregate of all the above earning
elements. Thus,
TE = BPE + DA + HRA + TRA
Provident Fund (PF) :  This can be calculated as PF = BPE * PF RatePF = BPE * PF RatePF = BPE * PF RatePF = BPE * PF RatePF = BPE * PF Rate
Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) : It is usually a fixed amount deducted
every month on account of TDS. In the last quarter of a year , the
investment details, which are permissible for tax deduction, are
received from employees to compute the quarterly and yearly income
tax liability more accurately.
Recovery of Loan Instalments (LOAN) :  It is a fixed amount to be
deducted on account of Loan Installment as part of loan recovery.
Total Deductions (TD) :  It is the total of all the above deductions.
Thus,
TD = PF + TDS + LOAN
Number of Effective Days Present (NOEDP)Number of Effective Days Present (NOEDP)Number of Effective Days Present (NOEDP)Number of Effective Days Present (NOEDP)Number of Effective Days Present (NOEDP)  – is the Number of Days
in a Month Minus Leave without Pay minus Unauthorised Absence, i.e.
NOEDP = (Number of Days in a Month)NOEDP = (Number of Days in a Month)NOEDP = (Number of Days in a Month)NOEDP = (Number of Days in a Month)NOEDP = (Number of Days in a Month)  – (Leave without Pay) –
(Unauthorised Absence) ; where (Number of Days in a Month) may be
denoted by NODM.

The Net Salary (NS) is the amount payable to an employee. It is obtained
by deducting Total Deductions (TD) from Total Earnings (TE) as given
below :
Net Salary (NS) = Total Earnings (TE) – Total Deductions (TD)Net Salary (NS) = Total Earnings (TE) – Total Deductions (TD)Net Salary (NS) = Total Earnings (TE) – Total Deductions (TD)Net Salary (NS) = Total Earnings (TE) – Total Deductions (TD)Net Salary (NS) = Total Earnings (TE) – Total Deductions (TD)
3.1.2.1 Template Design
Whenever we have to use a spreadsheet for any computations, the first
step is to plan its layout and the template specifying the sequence of
various columns, etc. The template also includes identification of cells,
which will contain formulae. The advantage of preparing the template
is that as a user puts in the values in the spreadsheet, the calculated
results are shown correspondingly. A table giving the contents of various
columns is a helpful tool to represent the template of a spreadsheet.
The following examp le will explain this process.
Example ExampleExampleExampleExample
There are 14 employees in M/s XY Z Enterprise. The payroll calculations
of these employees are given in the spreadsheet shown in Figure 3.3 (a)
and Figure 3.3 (b). These figures show the layout of the spreadsheet. In
a column, either a value is entered directly or else it is computed using
a formula. Such data are given in Figure 3.1. The rules for computing
some of the payroll elements used a bove are given in Figure 3.2.
Different data elements are arranged in the spreadsheet as follows:
• No. of Days in a Month (NODM) is entered in the cell G3
• DA Rate (in %) is entered in the cell G4
• HRA Rates (in %) for Supervisory (Emp Type = “Sup”) and Non-
supervisory (Emp Type = “Nsup”) are entered in the cells G5 and
G6, respectively.
• Transport Allowance for Supervisory (Emp T ype = “Sup”) and Non-
supervisory (Emp Type = “Nsup”) are entered in the cells G7 and
G8, respectively.
• PF Rate (in %) is entered in the cell G9.
Notes NotesNotes NotesNotes
• In columns I and J, nested-if function (i.e. an “IF” function within
another “IF” function) has been used. If function has been introduced
in Chapter 2.
• The formulae in column-F and column-G use absolute address ($G$3)
for cell G3 rather than using the relative address (G3). The absolute
address is used for those cells whose reference should not change
while the for mula is to be copied into other cells. The concept of
relative and absolute addressing of cells has been explained in
Chapter 2 earlier. Absolute addresses are also used in the formulae
used in columns H, I, and J.

3.2 ASSET ACCOUNTING
In this section, we shall be discussing the computation of amount of
depreciation to be charged on assets.
3.2.1 INTRODUCTION
Assets are resources of the organisation, which can be classified into
fixed and current assets. Fixed assets are long-term assets and provide
productive capability to the firm. The examples of fixed assets are
land, building, plant & machinery, etc. It includes both tangible and
intangible assets. Tangible assets are physical in nature, which have
form, shape and size. Intangible assets are resources capable of adding
value but do not have a physical dimension such as patents, copyrights,
trade mark, etc.
The depreciation on fixed assets is provided to recognise the cost of
the asset consumed during an accounting period since the life of such
assets extends beyond single accounting year . Usually, depreciation is
not provided on free hold land.
Total Amount of Depr eciation = Acquisition Cost – Salvage V alue
(Over Life of the Asset)
Year-to-date depr eciation is the accumulated depr eciation from the
date to which the asset is put to use till the curr ent accounting year .
Depreciation is calculated according to the policy of the organisation.
There are basically two methods, namely the Straight Line Method
(SLM) and the W ritten Down V alue Method (WDV). W e had studied
depreciation in our previous standard (XIth Standard) in Accountancy
Book Part I.
We will r ecall that asset accounting r equires maintenance of asset
register, computation of depr eciation and pr eparation of schedule of
fixed assets for reporting in the balance sheet as part of the annual
accounts. In order to prepare this report the depreciation calculation
sheet is also to be prepared.
3.2.2 COMPUTERISED ASSET ACCOUNTING
Assets are classified into the following categories:
• Goodwill
• Land: Free-hold land and Lease-hold land
• Building: Factory building, Office building, and Residential building
Year-to-date depr eciation is the accumulated depr eciation fr om the
date to which the asset is put to use till the curr ent accounting year.

• Plant and Machinery
• Furniture and Fixtures
• Vehicles
• Capital work in progress
• Others
The Companies Act, 1956 in Schedule-14 lists the rate of depreciation
to be used for different class of assets under Straight Line Method
(SLM) and W ritten Down V alue Method (WDV). The pr escribed rates
are different under two methods. For reporting purposes, corporate
enterprises may use either of the method and applicable rates. Let us
now understand the computation of depreciation using the two methods.
3.2.2.1 Straight Line Method (SLM)
The following is the formula for computation of depreciation:
• Acquisition Cost = Pur chase V alue + Other expenses, such as
Transportation Expenses, Installation Expenses and Pr e-operating
Expenses
• Total Depreciable Amount = Acquisition Cost - Salvage V alue
•
Total Depreciable AmountStraight Line Depreciaion  =  
Expected Useful Life
•
Straight Line Depreciation Rate of Depreciaion  =  × 100
Total Depreciable Amount
Example ExampleExample ExampleExample
The depreciation calculatio n (using SLM) is done using the Excel
spreadsheet, which is shown in Fig. 3.5 a and Fig. 3.5 b in two parts
due to the limitation of the page width. In each of the spreadsheet
column, either a value is entered directly or else it is computed using
a formula. Such data are given  in Figure 3.4.
Different data elements are arranged in the spreadsheet as follows:
• Year Beginning Date is enter ed in cell-C3
• Year End Date is enter ed in cell-F3
• First-Half Year End Date is enter ed in cell-E3
The salvage value of an asset is the value, which is realisable at the
end of its useful life.

3.2.2.2 Written Down Value (WDV) Method
Written Down Value (WDV) method uses the curr ent book value as the
base for computing the depreciation for the next period. It is also called
Declining Balance (DB) method and uses the Excel function DB to
compute the depreciation. The parameters of the function DB are as

3.3 LOAN REPAYMENT SCHEDULE
3.3.1 LOAN
Loan is a sum of borrowed money (termed as principal amount) for a
specified period at a pre-specified rate of interest. The loan is repaid
through a number of periodic (usually monthly) repayment instalments
over the loan repayment period.
3.3.1.1 Calculating Interest and Repayments of Loan
Computation of repayment installments is an iterative process. The
Excel’s built-in function, PMT can be used to compute monthly
instalments of repayment of loan. The parameters of the function PMT
are as follows:
The layout of the spreadsheet for loan repayment calculation is given
in Figure 3.13. In each column of the spreadsheet, either a value is
entered directly or else it is computed using a formula. Such data are
given in Figure 3.12.

Why is FV taken as zero (0) in the above calculations?
At the end of the loan period, the (balance) amount payable will be
zero assuming that the repayments are made on regular basis.
Therefore, the future value (FV) is taken as zero.

SummarySummarySummarySummarySummary
• MS-Excel is an easy and useful tool for various calculations carried out on spreadsheets.
In this chapter , thr ee examples have been taken to illustrate the ease and utility of
spreadsheets. These examples are Payroll Calculation, Fixed Asset Accounting, and Loan
Repayment Schedule.
• The first step in using spreadsheet is to list out the elements of the application. For each
element, it is determined whether a direct value is to be entered or else it is to be computed
using a formula.
• Excel has a rich library of various built-in functions including financial functions, which
can be directly used to carry out various (otherwise complex) calculations. A formula may
use one or more such functions.
• In these applications, some of the formulae use absolute address. The absolute address is
used for those cells whose content should not change while the formula containing such
cells is copied to other cells.
• If-function is also used in these applications. If-function is used to implement different
action corresponding to different conditions.
• The Excel functions SLN and DB are used for computation of depreciation using Straight
Line Method (SLM) and Written Down Value Method (WDVM), respectively. WDV Method is
also termed as declining balance (DB) method.
• The function PMT is used to compute the loan repayment schedule.
