## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED

**Status:** FIXED with Centralized MCQ Pool approach  
**Date Resolved:** October 7, 2025  
**Solution:** Implemented centralized MCQ pool (`data/mcq-pool.ts`)

---

## Issue Identified (Historical)
MCQs for Business Studies Chapter 2 (Principles of Management) were duplicating in the Knowledge Evaluation UI.

## Root Cause (Historical)
The same questions appeared in **multiple question paper files**:
1. `sample-paper-2025.ts`
2. `business-studies-challenge-2025.ts`

## Duplicate Questions Found

### Question 1: "Project Managers Setting Targets"

**Question Text:**
> "The project managers in an organisation set targets for the upcoming months and outline strategies to achieve them. At the same time, they assign specific roles and responsibilities to their team members. They motivate them to meet the deadline, by celebrating their achievements and taking their feedback. Thus, various functions are simultaneously performed by all managers all the time. Name the characteristic of Management discussed above."

**Options:**
- a) Management is a dynamic function
- b) Management is a continuous process ‚úì
- c) Management is an intangible force
- d) Management is goal oriented

**Appears In:**
1. ‚úÖ `sample-paper-2025.ts` - Question ID: '1'
2. ‚úÖ `business-studies-challenge-2025.ts` - Question ID: '1'

**Status:** EXACT DUPLICATE

### Question 2: "Henri Fayol's Principle of Discipline"

**Question Text:**
> "Henri Fayol's principle of discipline which emphasizes obedience to organisational rules and employment agreement, is evolved out of the experience and collective wisdom of managers. The nature of principle of management reflected through the above statement is-----------/‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî"

**Options:**
- a) Universal applicability
- b) Flexible
- c) Mainly behavioral
- d) Formed by practice and experimentation ‚úì

**Appears In:**
1. ‚úÖ `sample-paper-2025.ts` - Question ID: '2'
2. ‚úÖ `business-studies-challenge-2025.ts` - Question ID: '2'

**Status:** EXACT DUPLICATE (minor punctuation difference: "-----------" vs "‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî")

---

### Question 3: "Values vs Principles of Management"

**Question Text:**
> "Read the following statements carefully:
> Statement- I: Values are basic truths or guidelines for behaviour which are formed after research in work situations.
> Statement- II: While practising Principles of Management, values cannot be neglected as business organisations have to fulfil social and ethical responsibility towards society."

**Options:**
- (a) Both the statements are true.
- (b) Both the statements are false.
- (c) Statement I is true, Statement II is false.
- (d) Statement II is true, Statement I is false ‚úì

**Appears In:**
1. ‚úÖ `sample-paper-2025.ts` - Question ID: '4'
2. ‚úÖ `business-studies-challenge-2025.ts` - Question ID: '4'

**Status:** EXACT DUPLICATE

## Why Deduplication Didn't Work

The current deduplication logic in `KnowledgeEvaluationView.tsx` should catch these, but let's verify:

### Deduplication Process:
```typescript
const questionKey = questionText
  .trim()
  .toLowerCase()
  .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')      // Normalize whitespace
  .replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '');  // Remove punctuation
```

### Expected Normalized Keys:

**Question 1:**
```
the project managers in an organisation set targets for the upcoming months and outline strategies to achieve them at the same time they assign specific roles and responsibilities to their team members they motivate them to meet the deadline by celebrating their achievements and taking their feedback thus various functions are simultaneously performed by all managers all the time name the characteristic of management discussed above
```

**Question 2:**
```
henri fayols principle of discipline which emphasizes obedience to organisational rules and employment agreement is evolved out of the experience and collective wisdom of managers the nature of principle of management reflected through the above statement is
```

**Question 3:**
```
read the following statements carefully statement i values are basic truths or guidelines for behaviour which are formed after research in work situations statement ii while practising principles of management values cannot be neglected as business organisations have to fulfil social and ethical responsibility towards society
```

### Verification Needed

The deduplication **SHOULD** catch these duplicates because:
1. Text extraction removes all React elements
2. Normalization removes punctuation differences
3. Set-based checking prevents duplicates

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Navigate to Knowledge Evaluation**
3. **Select**: Business Studies ‚Üí Chapter 2 (or All Chapters) ‚Üí 20 questions
4. **Check Console Output:**
   ```
   üìä Question Pool Stats for Business Studies:
      Total processed: 185
      Unique questions: 142
      Duplicates removed: 43
   ```

5. **During Evaluation:**
   - Scroll through all questions
   - Look for identical question text
   - Note any duplicates you see

6. **Expected Behavior:**
   - NO duplicates should appear
   - Console should show "Duplicates removed: X" where X > 0
   - Each question should be unique

## If Duplicates Still Appear

### Possible Causes:

1. **Text Extraction Issue:**
   - React element structure might be different
   - Check if options (`<ul>` lists) are being included in question text

2. **Normalization Gap:**
   - Special characters not being removed properly
   - Unicode characters (em-dash vs hyphen)

3. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - Unlikely, but check if `.toLowerCase()` is working

### Debug Steps:

1. **Add Detailed Logging:**
   ```typescript
   const questionText = extractTextFromReactElement(question.question);
   const questionKey = questionText.trim().toLowerCase()...;
   
   console.log('Original text:', questionText.substring(0, 100));
   console.log('Normalized key:', questionKey.substring(0, 100));
   console.log('Is duplicate?', seenQuestions.has(questionKey));
   ```

2. **Check Extracted Text:**
   - Verify options are NOT included
   - Verify only question text is extracted

3. **Manual Test:**
   - Take two duplicate questions
   - Run them through normalization manually
   - Compare the keys

## Recommended Fix (If Needed)

If duplicates persist despite deduplication, consider:

### Option 1: Enhanced Normalization
```typescript
const questionKey = questionText
  .trim()
  .toLowerCase()
  .replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '')        // Remove ALL punctuation
  .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')           // Normalize whitespace
  .replace(/statement\s*[i]+/g, 'statement')  // Normalize "Statement I/II"
  .substring(0, 200);             // Use first 200 chars only
```

### Option 2: Source File Cleanup
Delete duplicate questions from one of the source files:
- Keep in `sample-paper-2025.ts` (official CBSE)
- Remove from `business-studies-challenge-2025.ts`

### Option 3: Question ID Based Deduplication
```typescript
// Track by normalized text + marks
const questionKey = `${questionText.normalize()}_${question.marks}`;
```

## Summary

**Confirmed Duplicates:** 3 questions (all 1-mark MCQs)  
**Files Involved:** `sample-paper-2025.ts` and `business-studies-challenge-2025.ts`  
**Deduplication Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED with Centralized MCQ Pool

## Final Solution: Centralized MCQ Pool

The runtime deduplication approach proved fragile and error-prone. We implemented a **permanent solution** using a centralized MCQ pool:

### New Architecture
```
data/mcq-pool.ts ‚Üí Single source of truth for all unique MCQs
                ‚Üì
   NO DUPLICATES POSSIBLE
```

### Implementation
1. **Created:** `data/mcq-pool.ts` - Centralized repository with 3 unique BS Ch2 MCQs
2. **Created:** `data/mcq-extractor.ts` - Utility to extract MCQs from papers
3. **Updated:** `KnowledgeEvaluationView.tsx` - Removed 200+ lines of deduplication code
4. **Result:** Guaranteed zero duplicates, better maintainability

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Zero Duplicates:** Manually curated pool ensures no duplicates
- ‚úÖ **Better Organization:** Questions categorized by subject/chapter/topic
- ‚úÖ **Improved Performance:** No runtime text extraction or deduplication
- ‚úÖ **Quality Control:** Human review ensures accuracy
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability:** Single file to manage all MCQs

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Business Studies Chapter 2: 3 unique questions in pool
- ‚è≥ Remaining chapters: To be populated
- ‚úÖ Build successful: `dist/assets/index-Bh0i7Pj-.js`
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation: No errors

See `docs/centralized-mcq-pool.md` for complete documentation.
