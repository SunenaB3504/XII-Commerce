## Overview (Historical Context)

The **Enhanced Knowledge Evaluation System** was a robust, intelligent assessment tool that combined the best features from both Knowledge Evaluation and MCQ Test Mode to provide comprehensive chapter-wise knowledge assessment with personalized study recommendations.

This version used **runtime deduplication** which was later replaced by the **Centralized MCQ Pool** approach for guaranteed zero duplicates.

## Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Question Pooling** (Updated to Centralized Pool)

**Previous Approach (Runtime Deduplication):**
- Aggregated MCQs from all question papers across all 3 subjects
- Automatic deduplication using aggressive text normalization
- Weighted selection based on CBSE exam chapter weightage
- Balanced distribution for specific chapter selection

**Current Approach (Centralized MCQ Pool):**
- Questions curated in `data/mcq-pool.ts` - single source of truth
- NO runtime deduplication needed - guaranteed unique
- Helper functions: `getMCQsBySubject()`, `getWeightedMCQs()`, `getRandomMCQs()`
- Weighted selection based on CBSE exam chapter weightage (preserved)
- Better organization with subject/chapter/topic metadata

### 2. **Flexible Filtering**
- **Subject Selection**: Choose from Business Studies, Accountancy, or Economics
- **Chapter Selection**: Multi-select chapters or choose "All Chapters"
- **Question Count**: 10, 20, or 50 questions
- **Dynamic Pool**: Always gets fresh questions from the latest papers

### 3. **Chapter Weightage System**

#### Business Studies
- Chapter 2 (Principles of Management): 20%
- Chapter 3 (Business Environment): 14%
- Chapter 1, 4, 5, 6, 7: 10% each
- Chapter 8 (Controlling): 8%
- Others: 2-4%

#### Accountancy
- Chapter 1: 15%
- Chapter 2: 12%
- Chapters 3-10: 8-10% each

#### Economics
- All chapters: Equal 10% weightage

### 4. **Advanced Performance Analysis**

#### Overall Metrics
- Total score and percentage

  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Practice (50-64%)
  - üö® Requires Focus (<50%)
- **Exam Weightage Display**: Shows CBSE weightage for context
- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of performance

#### Topic-level Insights
- Performance breakdown by topics within each chapter
- Weak topics highlighted with specific alerts
- Color-coded indicators (Green/Yellow/Red)

### 5. **Personalized Recommendations**

#### Overall Recommendation

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation: Centralized MCQ Pool

**File Structure:**
```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcq-pool.ts              # Single source of truth for all MCQs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MCQPoolQuestion interface (extends Question)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subject/chapter arrays (businessStudiesChapter1-11, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Helper functions (getMCQsBySubject, getWeightedMCQs, etc.)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcq-extractor.ts         # Utility to extract MCQs from papers
‚îÇ
components/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ KnowledgeEvaluationView.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Imports from mcq-pool
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poolQuestions() - uses centralized pool
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO deduplication code (removed)
```

**Question Selection Flow:**
```
User selects chapters ‚Üí poolQuestions() 
                              ‚Üì
                    getMCQsByChapters() or getWeightedMCQs()
                              ‚Üì
                    Centralized MCQ Pool (data/mcq-pool.ts)
                              ‚Üì
                    Random selection from pool
                              ‚Üì
                    Display in evaluation (NO DUPLICATES)
```

### Deduplication Logic (Historical - No Longer Used)

**Previous Runtime Approach:**
```typescript
const questionKey = questionText
  .trim()                        // Remove whitespace
  .toLowerCase()                 // Case-insensitive
  .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')         // Normalize spaces
  .replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '');     // Remove punctuation

if (!seenQuestions.has(questionKey)) {
  seenQuestions.add(questionKey);
  allQuestions.push(question);
}
```

**Current Approach:**
- No runtime deduplication needed
- Questions manually curated in pool
- Each question has unique ID (e.g., `BS-CH2-001`)
- Guaranteed zero duplicates at source

### Weighted Selection Algorithm
```typescript
// For "All Chapters" mode
- Calculate target count per chapter: (weightage / 100) * total
- Select randomly from each chapter based on target
- Fill remaining slots with random questions

// For specific chapters
- Distribute questions evenly across selected chapters
- Shuffle for randomization
```

### Scoring System
```typescript
// Extract correct answer from solution
const extractCorrectAnswer = (solution) => {
  const match = solutionText.match(/correct answer:\s*([a-d])\)/i);
  return match ? match[1].toLowerCase() : '';
};

// Compare with user answer
if (userAnswer === correctAnswer) {
  correctAnswers++;
}
```

```

## Performance Thresholds

### High-weightage Chapters (>15%)
- Excellent: ‚â•80%
- Good: ‚â•75%
- Needs Practice: 50-74%
- Requires Focus: <50%

### Normal Chapters
- Excellent: ‚â•80%
- Good: ‚â•70%
- Needs Practice: 50-69%
- Requires Focus: <50%

## Best Practices

### For Students
1. **Start with "All Chapters"** to identify weak areas
2. **Take 20-question tests** for balanced coverage
3. **Focus on high-weightage chapters** (Ch2, Ch3 in BS)
4. **Review topic-level insights** for targeted study
5. **Retake evaluation** after studying weak chapters

### For Teachers
1. Use results to identify class-wide weak topics
2. Adjust teaching focus based on performance patterns
3. Assign chapter-specific evaluations for remedial work
4. Track improvement over multiple evaluations
