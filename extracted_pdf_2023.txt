33. Return on Investment = EBIT / Capital Employed x  100  
 = 15,00,000/1,20,00,000 x 100 = 12.5%  
 
Capital  Employed = 12% Preference Share  Capital + Equity Share  Capital +  Reserves  and 
Surplus + 15%  Debentures + 10%  Bank  Loan = 30,00,000 + 40,00,000 + 10,00,000 + 
20,00,000 + 20,00,000 = ₹ 1,20,00,000 
EBIT = Profits after Tax +  Tax + Interest = 6,00,000 + 4,00,000 + 5,00,000 = ₹ 15,00,000 
 
Net Assets Turnover ratio = Revenue from Operations/Capital Employed  
= 3,60,00,000/1,20,00,000 = 3 times  
Or 
(i) Ratio  will  improve.  Reason – Capital  Employed  will  decrease  and  Debt  will  remain 
same 
(ii) Ratio  will  remain  same.  Reason – Both  Debt  and  Capital  Employed  will  remain 
same. 
(iii) Ratio  will  decline. Reason – Debt  will  decrease  but  Capital  Employed  will  remain 
same. 
(iv) Ratio  will  decline.  Reason – Capital  Employed  will  increase  but  Debt  will  remain

34. Two basic methods of charging depreciation are:  
Straight  line  method  :  This  method  calculates  fixed  amount  of  depreciation  every  year  which  is 
calculated keeping in view the useful life of assets and its salvage value at the end of its useful life.  
Written down value method: This method uses current book value of the asset for computing the 
amount of depreciation for the next period. It is also known as declining balance method..  
Differences:  
1. Equal  amount  of  depreciation  is  charged  in  straight  line  method.  Amount  of  depreciation 
6 

goes on decreasing every year in written down value method. 
2. Depreciation  is  charged  on  original  cost  in  straight  line  method.  The  amount  is  calculated 
on the book value every year.  
3. In  straight  line  method  the  value  of  asset  can  come  to  zero  but  in  written  down  value 
method this can never be zero.  
4. Generally  rate  of  depreciation  is  low  in  case  of  straight  line  method  but  it  is  kept  high  in 
case of written down value method.  
5. It is suitable for assets in which repair charges are less and the possibility of obsolescence is 
less. It is suitable for the assets which become obsolete due to changes in technology.
