        question: "III. Give two points to support why it is likely that fresh fruits were given as an option to the survey participants to choose from in the study on snacking preferences.",

Including fresh fruits allows researchers to directly evaluate preferences between natural, healthier choices and processed, potentially less healthy alternatives.",

        solution: "Targeted interventions can effectively address specific health needs by focusing on the unique factors influencing each demographic's snacking choices. For example, educational campaigns for parents can foster early healthy eating habits in children, while initiatives for teenagers can reduce the impact of advertising and peer pressure, promoting wiser food choices. Also, ensuring that middle-aged and older adults have access to fresh produce supports ongoing health maintenance, directly contributing to overall improved health outcomes across the lifespan.",
