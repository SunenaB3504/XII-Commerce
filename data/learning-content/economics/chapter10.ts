  title: "Human Capital Formation in India",
  overview: "This chapter explores the concept of 'human capital' â€“ the stock of skill and expertise of a nation at a point of time. We will learn how investments in education and health can be seen as investments in capital, similar to investing in machinery. We'll examine the sources of human capital, its crucial role in economic growth, and the state of the education sector in India.",

      scenario: "India's success in the global Information Technology (IT) sector is not due to abundant physical capital or natural resources. It is largely attributed to its vast pool of skilled and English-speaking software engineers. For decades, India invested in higher technical education through institutions like the IITs and other engineering colleges. This created a large stock of human capital with the specific skills needed by the global IT industry.",
