  title: "Open Economy Macroeconomics",
  overview: "This chapter expands our view from a closed economy to an open economy, which interacts with other countries through trade and finance. We will explore two key components: the Balance of Payments (BoP), which is a systematic record of all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world, and the Foreign Exchange Market, where currencies are traded and exchange rates are determined.",
