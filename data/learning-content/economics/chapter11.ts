  title: "Rural Development",
  overview: "This chapter addresses the critical issue of rural development in India, where a majority of the population resides. We will focus on the key challenges that hinder progress in rural areas, such as issues with credit and marketing, and explore various strategies to overcome them, including agricultural diversification and the promotion of organic farming.",

Historically, farmers relied on non-institutional sources like moneylenders, who charged exorbitant interest rates. After independence, the focus shifted to institutional sources like cooperatives, commercial banks, and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). NABARD (1982) is the apex body for rural credit, and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have emerged as a key mechanism for micro-credit."),

      scenario: "In the 1970s, India launched 'Operation Flood', a dairy development program. The cornerstone of this program was the cooperative structure, famously exemplified by Amul in Gujarat. Under this system, millions of milk producers in villages were encouraged to form cooperatives. They would pool their milk, which was then processed, graded, and marketed to urban centers by the cooperative union. Farmers were assured of a fair and regular price for their milk.",
