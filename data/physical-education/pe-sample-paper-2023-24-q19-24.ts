        question: "Goal setting is a mental training technique that can be used to increase an individual's commitment towards achieving a specific standard of proficiency on a task within a specified time. It is a process of establishing a level of performance proficiency which should be reached within a prescribed time period is known as goal setting.\n\n* It has proven effectiveness in enhancing performance and productivity in several contexts, including employee exercise programs, competitive sport, and industrial organizations, and provides a basis for both increasing a person's SELF-EFFICACY and for instilling a task with intrinsic worth.",

        question: "This method was introduced by J.J. Perrine in 1968 and involves a particular type of muscle contraction called isokinetic contraction, generally used in sporting events like rowing and swimming. These exercises are performed on specially designed instruments. In isokinetic contraction, the muscles apply maximal force throughout the range of motion around the joint. Whereas in isotonic contraction, the pressure is applied at a particular angle. The use of isokinetic contraction is minimal.\n\nExplain Isokinetic exercise with suitable examples",
        solution: "Isokinetic exercises involve muscle contractions where the speed of movement is kept constant throughout the range of motion, regardless of the force applied. Examples: Using a Cybex machine or swimming/rowing where water resistance accommodates force.",

        question: "Write a key point on cardio respiratory factors determining fitness.\n* Cardiovascular system - It consists of three parts: the heart, blood vessels and blood. Its major function is to deliver oxygen and nutrients, remove CO2 and other metabolic waste products, to transport hormones and other molecules, to support thermoregulation and control of body fluid balance and lastly to regulate immune function.\n* Respiratory system - The important parts of the respiratory system are the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Air can also enter the respiratory system through the oral cavity. Its major functions include, transporting air to the lungs, exchanging gases (O2 and CO2) between the air and blood, and regulating blood pH.",
