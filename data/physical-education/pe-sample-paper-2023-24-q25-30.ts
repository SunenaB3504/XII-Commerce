The name comes from Greek phyton, meaning 'plant'.\n* Anthocyanins: Anthocyanins give grapes, blueberries, cranberries, and raspberries their dark colour.\n* Flavonoids or isoflavones: These are found in vegetables, fruits and grains like soybeans, chickpeas and may act a little bit like oestrogen.\n* Artificial Sweeteners: These are synthetic compounds that duplicate the taste of sugar, but contain less energy, and, therefore, are often added to diet foods and beverages.\n* Preservatives: These are compounds that have the ability to inhibit microbial growth and are often added to food and beverage products to prolong shelf life.\n* Spices: A spice is a dried seed, fruit, root, bark or vegetable substance primarily used for flavouring, colouring or preserving food.\n* Coffee: Coffee is a brewed beverage prepared from the roasted or baked seeds of several species of Coffee.",
