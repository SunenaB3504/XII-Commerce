        solution: "(b) Both (A) and (R) are true but(R) is not the correct explanation of (A)",
        explanation: "**Chapter 2: Sports and Nutrition**\n\n**Topic: Vitamins**\n\nAssertion is true: Vitamin C deficiency causes Scurvy. Reason is true: Fresh fruits/vegetables are sources of Vitamin C. However, the MS marks this as (b), implying the reason explains the cause of deficiency rather than the disease physiology itself, or it's a specific CBSE interpretation."
