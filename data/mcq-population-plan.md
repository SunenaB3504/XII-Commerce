## Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Manual Population (Recommended for Quality)
**Time Required:** ~6-8 hours
**Approach:**
1. Copy each MCQ's complete React.createElement structure
2. Assign unique IDs (ACC-CH1-001 format, ECON-CH1-001 format)
3. Add metadata (chapter, topic, difficulty, weightage)
4. Verify build after each batch of 5-10 questions
5. Test in UI to ensure proper rendering

**Pros:**
- Highest quality and accuracy
- Proper metadata assignment
- Immediate error detection
- Complete control over formatting

**Cons:**
- Time-intensive
- Requires careful attention to detail

### Option 2: Automated Extraction with Manual Review
**Time Required:** ~3-4 hours
**Approach:**
1. Use the mcq-extractor.ts utility
2. Automated text extraction and ID assignment
3. Manual review and correction of each question
4. Metadata assignment in batch
5. Comprehensive testing

**Pros:**
- Faster initial population
- Consistent formatting
- Reduced manual typing errors

**Cons:**
- React.createElement complexity may cause issues
- Still requires significant review time
- Potential for extraction errors

### Option 3: Incremental Population (Current Approach)
**Time Required:** ~10-12 hours (spread over multiple sessions)
**Approach:**
1. Add 5-10 MCQs per session
2. Build and test after each batch
3. Commit progress incrementally
4. Continue until all 43 MCQs are added

**Pros:**
- Manageable workload
- Regular progress tracking
- Lower risk of large-scale errors
- Can pause and resume easily

**Cons:**
- Takes longer overall
- Multiple commits needed
- Requires sustained effort over time
