32 (a).Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities 
 
2 = 8,00,000 / Current Liabilities 
So, Current Liabilities = ₹ 4,00,000 
 
Liquid Ratio = Liquid Assets / Current Liabilities 
1.5 = Liquid Assets / 4,00,000 
 
So, Liquid Assets =  ₹ 6,00,000 
Inventory = Current Assets - Liquid Assets 
Inventory = 8,00,000 – 6,00,000 = ₹ 2,00,000 
Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Revenue From Operations / Average Inventory 
6 = Cost of Revenue from Operations / 2,00,000 
 
Cost of Revenue from Operations = ₹ 12,00,000 
 
Gross Profit = 25% of Cost i.e ₹ 3,00,000 
 
Revenue From Operations = Cost of Revenue from Operations + Gross Profit = 12,00,000 + 3,00,000 
Revenue From Operations = ₹ 15,00,000 
 
(a) Debt to Capital employed ratio = Debt / Capital Employed 
3 

 
 Debt to Capital employed ratio  = 7,50,000 / (7,50,000 + 15,00,000) = 7,50,000 / 22,50,000

Two basic methods of charging depreciation are: 
Straight line method: This method calculates fixed amount of depreciation every year which is 
calculated keeping in view the useful life of assets and its salvage value at the end of its useful life. 
Written down value method: This method uses current book value of the asset for computing the 
amount of depreciation for the next period. It is also known as declining balance method. 
Differences: 
1. Equal amount of depreciation is charged in straight line method. Amount of depreciation 
goes on decreasing every year in written down value method. 
2. Depreciation is charged on original cost in straight line method. The amount is calculated 
on the book value every year. 
3. In straight line method the value of asset can come to zero but in written down value 
method this can never be zero. 
4. Generally rate of depreciation is low in case of straight line method but it is kept high in 
case of written down value method. 
5. It is suitable for assets in which repair charges are less and the possibility of obsolescence is 
             less. It is suitable for the assets which become obsolete due to changes in technology.
