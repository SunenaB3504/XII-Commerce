worldwide  the  company  has  chosen  to  share  decision  making  authority  with  lower  levels 
and place it nearest to the point of action. Therefore the response does not take time. This

propagates  the  belief  that  people  are  competent,  capable  and  resourceful  who  can  get  a 
chance  to  prove  their  abilities.  And  enables  the  company  in  identifying  those  executives 
who  have  the  necessary  potential  to  become  dynamic  leaders,  so  that  the  checking 
required  on  decisions  taken  by  lower  levels  of  management  is  the  least.  This  makes  it

have great popularity and acceptability in the markets.

Coordination 
The process by which a manager synchronizes the activities of different 
departments is known as coordination. 
Coordination is the force that binds all the other functions of management. It 
is the common thread that runs through all activities. It is implicit and inherent 
in all functions of an organization.

Merits of external sources: (Any three) 
1. Qualified personnel: By using external sources of recruitment, the 
management can attract qualified and trained people to apply for 
vacant jobs in the organization. 
2. Wider choice: When vacancies are advertised wisely, a large number of 
applicants from outside the organization can apply. The management 
has a wider choice while selecting the people for employment. 
3. Fresh Talent: The present employees may be insufficient or they may 
not fulfill the specifications of the jobs to be filled. External 
recruitment provides wider choice and brings new blood in the 
organization. 
4. Competitive spirit: If a company taps external sources, the existing 
sources, the existing staff will have to compete with the outsiders. 
They will work harder to show better performance.

Critical point control: It is neither economical nor easy to keep a check on each 
and every activity in an organization. 
 Control should therefore focus on key result areas which are critical to the 
success of an organization.  
(2+1 = 3)  
 

These KRAs are set as the critical points. If anything goes wrong at the critical 
points, the entire organization suffers. 
 For instance, in a manufacturing organization, an increase of 5% in the labour 
cost may be more troublesome than a 15% increase in postal charges. 
OR 
 
Management by Exception: Management by exception, which is often referred 
to  as  control  by  exception,  is  an  important  principle  of management  control 
based on the belief that an attempt to control everything results in controlling 
nothing.  
Thus, only significant  deviations which go beyond the permissible  limit  should 
be brought to the notice of the management.  
For instance, if the plans lay down 2% increase in labour cost as an acceptable 
range  of deviation in a manufacturing organization, only  an increase  in labour 
cost beyond 2% should be brought to the notice of the management. However, 
in  case  of  major  deviation  from  the  standard  (say,  5%),  the  matter  has  to 
receive immediate action of management on a priority basis.

one such meaning for the word used by the communicator.

may creep in causing different meanings to communication. 
4. Some communications may have certain assumptions which are

3. Perquisites:  In  many  companies  perquisites  and  fringe  benefits  are 
offered  such  as  car  allowance,  housing,  medical  aid  and  education  to 
the children, etc., over and above the salary. 
4. Co-partnership/stock    option:     Under    these     incentive     schemes, 
employees  are  offered  company  shares  at  a  set  price  which  is  lower 
than market price. Sometimes, management may allot shares in line of 
various incentives payable in cash.

28 Following are the factors affecting capital structure  of a company : (Any 
four)                                                                                   
1. Size   of   the   projected   Cash   flows   must   be   considered   before 
borrowing.  
2. Interest Coverage Ratio refers to the number of times earnings before 
interest and taxes of a company covers the interest obligation. 
3. Debt  Service  Coverage  Ratio  takes  care  of  the  deficiencies  referred  to 
(1X4=4)

in the interest coverage ratio.  
4. More debt can be used if debt can be raised at a lower rate 
5. A  higher  Tax  Rate  makes  debt  relatively  cheaper  and  increases  its 
attraction vis-a-vis equity. 
6. Process of  raising  resources  also  involves  some  cost  which  may  affect 
the choice between debt and equity and hence capital structure. 
7. If a firm’s business risk is lower, its capacity to use debt is higher and 
vice versa. 
8. To  maintain  flexibility  the  firm  must  maintain  some  borrowing  power 
to take care of unforeseen circumstances. 
9. Capital Structure of other companies is a useful guideline in the capital 
structure planning.  
10. Stock  Market  Conditions  often  affect  the  choice  between  debt  and 
equity. 
11. Every  company operates  within  a  regulatory  framework  provided  by 
the law. 
12. Control as a factor also influences the choice between debt and equity 
especially in companies in which the current holding of management is 
on a lower side. 
13. If  the  ROI  of  the  company  is  higher, it  can  choose  to  use  trading  on 
equity to increase its EPS.  
14. When a company increases debt, the financial risk faced by the equity 
shareholders  increases  consequently  their  desired  rate  of  return  may 
increase. 
OR 
Factors affecting financing decision: (Any four)  
1. A prudent financial manager would normally opt for a source which is 
the cheapest. 
2. The risk associated with each of the sources is different. 
3. Higher the floatation cost, less attractive the source. 
4. A stronger cash flow position may make debt financing more viable 
than funding through equity. 
5. If a business has high fixed operating costs, it must reduce fixed 
financing costs. 
6. Issues of more equity may lead to dilution of management’s control 
over the business.  
7. Health of the capital market may also affect the choice of source of 
funds.

Earning before tax = ₹. 35,00,000 
 
EBIT = Earning before tax + Interest     
         =  35,00,000 + 3,50,000 
         =   ₹. 38,50,000 
ROI= EBIt/total Investment  ×  100= 38,50,000 / 1,20,00,000 × 100 = 32.08% 
As  ROI  (32.08%)  >  Rate  of  interest  (7%).    The  company  can  choose to  use 
trading  on  equity  to  increase  its  EPS.  The  finance  manager was justified  in 
making this recommendation.

A consumer should keep in mind the following responsibilities while 
purchasing, using and consuming goods and services (Any four)— 
(i)  Be  aware about various goods and services available in the market  so that 
an intelligent and wise choice can be made. 
 
(ii)  Buy  only  standardized  goods  as  they  provide  quality  assurance.  Thus,  look 
for  ISI  mark  on  electrical  goods,  FPO  mark  on  food  products,  Hallmark  on 
jewelry, etc. 
 
(iii)   Learn   about   the   risks   associated   with   products   and   services,   follow 
manufacturer’s instructions and use the products safely. 
 
(iv)  Read  labels  carefully  so  as  to  have  information  about  prices,  net  weight, 
manufacturing and expiry dates, etc. 
 
(v) Assert yourself to ensure that you get a fair deal. 
 
(vi) Be honest in your dealings. Choose only from legal goods and services and 
discourage unscrupulous practices like black-marketing, hoarding, etc. 
 
(viii) File a complaint in an appropriate consumer forum in case of a 
shortcoming in the quality of goods purchased or services availed. Do not fail 
to take an action even when the amount involved is small. 
 
(ix) Form consumer societies which would play an active part in educating 
consumers and safeguarding their interests. 
 
(x) Respect the environment. Avoid waste, littering and contributing to 
pollution.

Techniques of Scientific Management given by F.W.Taylor: 
 
Method Study 
The  objective  of  method  study  is  to  find  out  one  best  way  of  doing  the  job. 
There are various methods of doing the job. To determine the best way there 
are  several  parameters.  Right  from  procurement of  raw  materials till  the  final 
product  is  delivered  to  the  customer  every  activity  is  part  of  method  study. 
Taylor  devised  the  concept  of  assembly  line  by  using  method  study.  Ford 
Motor 
Company  used  this  concept  very  successfully.  Even  now  auto  companies  are 
using it. 
The objective of  the  whole  exercise  is to minimize  the  cost  of  production and 
maximize  the  quality  and  satisfaction  of  the  customer.  For  this  purpose  many 
techniques like process charts and operations research etc. are used. 
For  designing  a  car,  the  assembly  line  production  would  entail  deciding  the 
sequence  of  operations,  place  for  men,  machines  and  raw  materials  etc.  All 
this is part of method study. 
 
 
(b) Functional foremanship is an extension of the  principle of division of work 
and specialization to the shop floor. Each worker will have to take orders from 
these eight foremen in the related process or function of production. Foremen 
should  have  intelligence,  education,  tact,  grit,  judgment,  special  knowledge, 
manual   dexterity,   and   energy,   honesty   and   good   health.   Since   all  these 
qualities   could not   be   found   in   a   single   person,   Taylor   proposed   eight 
specialists. Each specialist is to be assigned work according to her/his qualities. 
For  example,  those  with  technical  mastery,  intelligence  and  grit may  be  given 
planning work. Those with energy and good health may be assigned execution 
work 
 
(  c  )  Standardization  refers  to  the  process  of  setting  standards  for  every 
business  activity;  it  can  be  standardization  of  process,  raw  material,  time, 
product,  machinery,  methods  or  working  conditions.  These  standards  are  the 
benchmarks, which must be adhered to during production. The Objective Of 
(i) To reduce a given line or product to fixed types, sizes and characteristics. 
(ii) To establish interchangeability of manufactured parts and products. 
(iii) To establish standards of excellence and quality in materials. 
(iv) To establish standards of performance of men and machines 
 
(d)  Taylor  was  a  strong  advocate  of  a  piece  wage  system.  He  wanted  to 
differentiate between efficient and inefficient workers. The standard time and 
other  parameters  should  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  work- study 
discussed  above.  The  workers  can  then  be  classified  as  efficient  or  inefficient 
on the basis of these standards. He wanted to reward efficient workers. So he 
introduced  different  rates  of  wage  payment  for  those  who  performed  above 
standard and for those who performed below standard.

Principles of Management given by Henry Fayol: 
 
(a)Unity  of  Command:  According  to  Fayol  there  should  be  one  and  only  one 
boss  for  every  individual  employee.  If  an  employee  gets  orders  from  two 
superiors  at  the  same  time  the  principle of  unity of command  is  violated.  The 
principle   of   unity   of   command   states   that   each   participant   in   a   formal 
organization  should  receive  orders  from  and  be  responsible  to  only  one 
superior.  Fayol  gave  a  lot  of  importance  to  this  principle.  He  felt  that  if  this 
principle is violated “authority is undermined; discipline is in jeopardy,  order 
disturbed  and  stability  threatened”.  The  principle  resembles  military 
organization.   Dual   subordination   should   be   avoided.   This   is   to   prevent 
confusion regarding tasks to be done. Suppose a sales person is asked to clinch 
a  deal  with  a  buyer and  is  allowed  to  give  a  10%  discount  by  the  marketing 
manager.  But  the  finance  department  tells  her/  him  not  to  offer  more  than  a 
5% discount. Now there is no unity of command. This can be avoided if there is 
coordination between various departments. 
 
b) Equity:  Good  sense  and  experience  are  needed  to  ensure  fairness  to  all 
employees, who should be treated as fairly as possible,” according to Fayol. 
This  principle  emphasizes  kindliness  and  justice  in  the  behavior  of  managers 
towards workers. This will ensure loyalty and devotion. Fayol does not rule out 
use  of  force  sometimes.  Rather  he  says  that  lazy  personnel  should  be  dealt 
with  sternly  to  send  the  message  that  everyone  is  equal  in  the  eyes  of  the 
management. There should be no discrimination against anyone on account of 
sex,  religion,  language,  caste,  belief  or  nationality  etc.  In  practice  we  can 
observe  that  now  a  days  in  multinational  corporations  people  of  various 
nationalities   work   together   in   a   discrimination   free   environment.   Equal 
opportunities are available for everyone in such companies to rise. 
( c )Remuneration of Employees: The overall pay and compensation should be 
fair  to  both  employees  and  the  organization.  The  employees  should  be  paid 
fair wages, which should give them at least a reasonable standard of living. At 
the same time it should be within the paying capacity of the company. In other 
words, remuneration should be just and equitable. This will ensure a congenial 
atmosphere    and    good    relations    between    workers    and    management. 
Consequently, the working of the company would be smooth. 
 
(d) Initiative:  Workers should be encouraged to develop and carry out their 
plans for improvements according to Fayol. Initiative means taking the first 
step with self-motivation. It is thinking out and executing the plan. It is one of 
the traits of an intelligent person. Initiative should be encouraged. But it does 
not mean going against the established practices of the company for the sake 
of being different. A good company should have an employee suggestion 
system whereby initiative/suggestions which result in substantial cost/time 
reduction should be 
 

32 Steps   in   the   process   of   planning   to   be   followed   by   a   manager   before 
performing the step of evaluation of alternatives: 
Setting  Objectives:  The  first  and  foremost  step  is  setting  objectives.  Every 
organization must have certain objectives. Objectives may be set for the entire 
organization  and  each  department  or  unit  within  the  organization.  Objectives 
or  goals  specify  what  the  organization  wants  to  achieve.  It  could  mean  an 
increase   in   sales   by   20%   which   could   be   the   objective   of   the   entire 
organization.  How all  departments  would  contribute  to  the  organizational 
goals is the plan that is to be drawn up. Objectives should be stated clearly for 
all  departments,  units  and  employees.  They  give  direction to  all  departments. 
Departments/  units  then  need  to  set  their  own  objectives  within  the  broad 
framework of the organization’s philosophy. Objectives have to percolate 
down  to  each  unit  and  employees  at  all  levels.  At  the  same  time,  managers 
must  contribute  ideas  and  participate  in  the  objective  setting  process.  They 
must  also  understand  how  their  actions  contribute  to  achieving  objectives.  If 
the end result is clear it becomes easier to work towards the goal. 
(ii)  Developing  Premises:  Planning  is  concerned  with  the  future  which  is 
uncertain  and  every  planner  is  using  conjecture  about  what  might  happen  in 
future. Therefore, the manager is required to make certain assumptions about 
the  future.  These  assumptions  are  called  premises.  Assumptions  are  the  base 
material  upon  which  plans  are  to  be  drawn.  The  base  material  may  be  in  the 
form  of  forecasts,  existing  plans  or  any  past  information  about  policies.  The 
premises  or  assumptions  must  be  the  same  for  all  and  there  should  be  total 
agreement on them. All managers involved in planning should be familiar with 
and  use  the  same  assumptions.  For  example,  forecasting  is  important  in 
developing  premises  as  it  is  a  technique  of  gathering  information.  Forecasts 
can  be  made  about  the  demand  for  a  particular  product,  policy  change, 
interest   rates,   prices   of   capital   goods,   tax   rates   etc.   Accurate   forecasts 
therefore become essential for successful plans. 
  (iii)   Identifying   alternative   courses   of   action:   Once   objectives   are   set, 
assumptions are made. Then the next step would be to act upon them. There 
may be many ways to act and achieve objectives. All the alternative courses of 
action should be identified. The course of action which may be taken could be 
either routine or innovative. An innovative course may be adopted by involving 
more  people  and  sharing  their  ideas.  If  the  project  is important,  then  more 
alternatives   should   be   generated   and   thoroughly   discussed   amongst   the 
members of the organization.

The next three steps are :

assumptions are made. Then the next step would be to act upon them. There

may be many ways to act and achieve objectives. All the alternative courses of 
action should be identified. The course of action which may be taken could be 
either routine or innovative. An innovative course may be adopted by involving 
more  people  and  sharing  their  ideas.  If  the  project  is  important,  then  more 
alternatives   should   be   generated   and   thoroughly   discussed   amongst   the 
members of the organization. 
ii)  Evaluating  alternative  courses:  The  next  step  is  to  weigh  the  pros  and cons 
of  each  alternative.  Each  course  will  have  many  variables  which  have  to  be 
weighed   against   each   other.   The   positive   and   negative   aspects   of   each 
proposal  need  to  be  evaluated  in  the  light  of  the  objective  to  be  achieved.  In 
financial plans, for example, the risk‐return trade‐off is very common. The 
more  risky  the  investment,  the  higher  the  returns  it  is  likely  to  give.  To 
evaluate  such  proposals  detailed  calculations  of  earnings,  earnings  per  share, 
interest,  taxes,  dividends  are made  and  decisions  taken.  Accurate  forecasts  in 
conditions  of  certainty/uncertainty  then  become  vital  assumptions  for  these 
proposals.  Alternatives   are   evaluated  in  the  light  of  their  feasibility  and 
consequences. 
(iii) Selecting an alternative: This is the real point of decision making. The best 
plan has to be adopted and implemented. The ideal plan, of course, would be 
the most feasible, profitable and with least negative consequences. Most plans 
may  not  always  be  subjected  to  a  mathematical  analysis.  In  such  cases, 
subjectivity and the manager’s experience, judgment and at times,  intuition 
play  an  important  part  in  selecting  the  most  viable  alternative.  Sometimes,  a 
combination of plans may be selected instead of one best course. The manager 
will have to apply permutations and combinations and select the best possible 
course of action.

Importance of Decentralization: 
 
1. “Response  does  not  take  time”.  Quick  decision  making- In   a 
decentralized organization since decisions are taken at levels which are 
nearest   to   the   point   of   action   and   there   is   no   requirement   for 
approvals from many levels, the process is much faster. 
2. “Who can get a chance to prove their abilities”. Develops managerial 
talent  for  the  future- Decentralization  gives  managers  a  chance  to 
prove their abilities and creates a reservoir of qualified manpower that 
can   be   considered   to   fill   up   more   challenging   positions   through 
promotion. 
3. “Identifying those executives who have the necessary potential to 
become  dynamic  leaders”. Develops initiative among subordinates- 
Decentralization   helps   to   promote   self-reliance   and   confidence 
amongst  the  subordinates.  It  also keeps them  in  a  state  wherein  they 
are   constantly   challenged   and   have   to   develop   solutions   for   the 
various problems they encounter. 
4. “This makes it possible to evaluate performance at each level and each 
department  can  be  individually  held  accountable  for  their  results.”

34 Functions of marketing, apart from the ones Choco Ltd is already performing: 
(Any four) 
1. Gathering  and  analyzing  market  information:  This  is  necessary  to 
identify the needs of the customers and make various decisions for the 
successful marketing of the products and services. This is important for 
making an analysis of the available opportunities and threats as well as 
strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  organization  and  help  in  deciding 
what opportunities can best be pursued by it. 
2. Product   designing   and   development:   The   design   of   the   product 
contributes  to  making  the  product  attractive  to  the  target  customers. 
A  good  design  can  improve  performance  of  a  product  and  give  it  a 
competitive advantage in the market. 
3. Standardization:    Standardization    refers    to    producing    goods    of 
predetermined  specifications  which  help  in  achieving  uniformity  and 
consistency in the output  
4. Packaging  and  labeling- Packaging  refers  to  designing  and  developing 
the   package   for   the   products.   Labeling   refers   to   designing   and 
developing the label to be put on the product. 
5. Transportation- Transportation  involves  physical  movement  of goods 
from   one   place   to   another.   As   generally   the   users   of   products 
particularly  consumer  products  are  wide  spread  and  geographically 
separated from the place where they are produced. 
6. Storage   and   warehousing- In   order   to   maintain   smooth   flow   of 
products  in the  market,  there  is  a  need  for  proper  storage  of  the 
products. Further there is need for storage of adequate stock of goods 
to  protect  against  unavoidable  delays  in  delivery  or  to  meet  out 
contingencies   in   the   demand.   Ram   Kumar   the  CEO   of   Sabarmati 
Enterprises in a meeting with the middle management of the company 
advised  that  the  personal  goals  of  the  people  should  be  reconciled 
with  the  organizational  objectives  for  harmony  in  the  organization. 
Briefly explain the objective of management that he was referring to.
