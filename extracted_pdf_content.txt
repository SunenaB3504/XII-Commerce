responsible for promoting exhibitions and events. In the previous season, she

Single Use plans- A single-use plan is developed for a one-time event or 
project. Such a course of action is not likely to be repeated in future, i.e., they 
are for non-recurring situations.The duration of this plan may depend upon 
the type of the project. It may span a week or a month or a day. 
Standing  plans-A  standing  plan  is  used  for  activities  that  occur  regularly 
over a period of time. It is designed to ensure that internal operations of an 
organisation run smoothly. Such a plan greatly enhances efficiency in routine 
decision-making.  It  is  usually  developed  once  but  is  modified  from  time  to 
time to meet business needs as required. 
OR 
Planning  reduces creativity- Planning is an activity which is done by the 
top  management.  Usually  the  rest  of  the  members  just  implement  these

plans. As a consequence, middle management and other decision makers 
are  neither  allowed  to  deviate  from  plans  nor  are  they  permitted  to  act  on 
their  own.Thus,  planning  in  a  way  reduces  creativity  since  people  tend  to 
think along the same lines as others. 
 
Planning leads to rigidity-In an organisation, a well-defined plan is drawn 
up  with  specific  goals  to  be  achieved  within  a  specific  time frame.  These 
plans then decide the future course of action and managers may not be in a 
position  to  change  it.  Following  a  pre-decided  plan,  when  circumstances 
have changed, may not turn out to be in the organisation's interest.

Leadership is the process of influencing the behaviour of people by making 
them strive voluntarily towards achievement of organisational goals. 
Two situations in which Autocratic leadership is most effective:

situations  like  in  a  factory  where  the  supervisor  is  responsible  for 
production   on   time   and   the   supervisor   has   to   ensure   labour 
productivity.  
• Quick decision-making is facilitated. 
OR 
Communication is the process of exchange of information between two or 
more persons to reach common understanding.

organisation chart.

Communication that takes place without following the formal lines of 
communication is said to be informal communication.

may affect its performance.  
(II) It  enables  the  firm  to  identify  opportunities  and  getting  the  first 
mover  advantage: Opportunities  refer  to  the  positive  external  trends  or 
changes  that  will  help  a  firm  to  improve  its  performance.  Environment 
provides numerous opportunities for business success. Early identification of 
opportunities  helps  an  enterprise  to  be  the  first  to exploit  them  instead  of 
losing them to competitors

25. (I) Management is an intangible force: Management is an intangible force 
that cannot be seen but its presence can be felt in the way the organisation 
functions. The effect of management is noticeable in an organisation where 
targets are met according to plans, employees are happy and satisfied, and 
there is orderliness instead of chaos. 
(II) Importance of management: (Any three) 
• Management  helps  in  achieving  group  goals: Management  is 
required not for itself but for achieving the goals of the organisation. 
The task of a manager is to give a common direction to the individual 
effort in achieving the overall goal of the organisation.  
• Management  increases  efficiency: The  aim  of  a  manager  is  to 
reduce  costs  and  increase  productivity  through  better  planning, 
organising,  directing,  staffing  and  controlling  the  activities  of  the 
organisation. 
• Management  creates  a  dynamic  organisation: All  organisations 
have to function in an environment which is constantly changing. It is 
generally seen that individuals in an organisation resist change as it 
often means moving from a familiar, secure environment into a newer 
and more challenging one. Management helps people adapt to these 
changes  so  that  the  organisation  is  able  to  maintain  its  competitive 
edge.  
• Management helps in achieving personal objectives: A manager 
motivates  and  leads  his  team  in  such  a  manner  that  individual 
members are able to achieve personal goals while contributing to the 
overall organisational objective. 
• Management helps in the development of society: An  organisation 
has  multiple  objectives  to  serve  the  purpose  of  the  different  groups 
that  constitute  it.  In  the  process  of  fulfilling  all  these,  management 
helps in the development of the organisation and through that it helps 
in the development of society.

Selection tests (Any four): 
• Intelligence Tests: This is one of the important psychological tests used 
to measure the level of intelligence quotient of an individual. It is an 
indicator of a person’s learning ability or the ability to make decisions 
and judgments.  
• Aptitude  Test: It  is a measure of an  individual's  potential  for  learning 
new skills. It indicates the person’s capacity to develop. 
• Personality  Tests:  Personality  tests  provide  clues  to  a  person’s 
emotions, her reactions, maturity and value system etc. These tests 
probe the overall personality. Hence, these are difficult to design and 
implement. 
• Trade  Test: These  tests  measure  the  existing  skills  of  the  individual. 
They measure the level of knowledge and proficiency in the area of 
professions or technical training. The difference between aptitude test 
and  trade  test  is  that  the  former  measures  the  potential to  acquire 
skills and the later the actual skills possessed.

Benefit of training to workers: 
• Improved skills and knowledge due to training lead to better careers for 
the individual. 
• Increased performance by the individual helps him to earn more. 
• Training makes the employee more efficient to handle machines. Thus, 
less prone to accidents.  
• Training increases the satisfaction and morale of employees.

appreciation is given to the work performed by employees, they feel 
motivated to perform/work at a higher level.  
• Employee  Participation:It  means  involving  employees  in  decision 
making  of  the  issues  related  to  them.  In  many  companies,  these 
programmes   are   in   practice   in   the   form   of   joint   management 
committees, work committees, canteen committees etc.

Plans  are  prepared  for  the future  and are  based  on  forecasts  about  future 
conditions.  Therefore, planning involves  looking  ahead  and  is  called  a 
forward-looking function. 
On the contrary, controlling is like a postmortem of past activities to find out 
deviations  from  the  standards.  In  that  sense, controlling  is  a  backward 
looking function.  
However, planning is guided by past experiences and the corrective action 
initiated by  the  control  function  aims  to  improve  future performance.  Thus, 
planning  and  controlling  are  both  backward-looking  as  well  as  a 
forward-looking function.  
OR 
• Measurement  of  Actual  Performance:  Once  performance  standards 
are   set,   the   next   step   is   measurement   of   actual   performance. 
Performance  should  be  measured  in  an  objective  and reliable  manner. 
There  are  several  techniques  for  measurement  of  performance.  These 
include personal observation, sample checking, performance reports. 
• Comparing  Actual  Performance  with  Standards:  This  step  involves 
comparison  of actual  performance  with  the standard.  Such  comparison 
will reveal the deviation between actual and desired results. Comparison 
becomes easier when standards are set in quantitative terms.

 Features of Planning 
(1)  Planning focuses on achieving objectives: Organisations are set up 
with a general purpose in view. Specific goals are set out in the plans 
along  with  the  activities  to  be  undertaken  to  achieve  the  goals.  Thus, 
planning is purposeful. Planning has no meaning unless it contributes to 
the achievement of predetermined organisational goals.

(2)  Planning is futuristic: Planning essentially involves looking ahead and 
preparing for the future. The purpose of planning is to meet future events 
effectively to the best advantage of an organisation. It implies peeping 
into  the  future,  analysing  it  and  predicting  it.  Planning  is,  therefore, 
regarded as a forward looking function based on forecasting. 
(3)   Planning  involves  decision  making: Planning  essentially  involves 
choice  from  among  various  alternatives  and  activities.  The  need  for 
planning arises only when alternatives are available. In actual practice, 
planning  presupposes  the  existence  of  alternatives.  Planning,  thus, 
involves  thorough  examination  and  evaluation  of  each  alternative  and 
choosing the most appropriate one.  
(4)  Planning is a mental exercise:Planning requires application of the mind 
involving   foresight,   intelligent   imagination  and   sound   judgement.   It   is 
basically  an  intellectual  activity  of  thinking  rather  than  doing,  because 
planning  determines  the  action  to  be  taken.  However,  planning  requires 
logical and systematic thinking rather than guesswork or wishful thinking.

30. Following are the differences between advertising and personal selling  
(any four): 
S.No. Advertising  Personal Selling  
1. Advertising is an impersonal form 
of communication 
Personal selling is a 
personal form of 
communication. 
2. Advertising  involves  transmission 
of   standardised   messages,   i.e., 
the same message is sent.  
In personal selling, the sales 
talk is adjusted keeping view 
of the customer's 
background and needs. 
3. Advertising   is   inflexible   as   the 
message can’ t be adjusted to the 
needs of the buyer.  
Personal   selling   is   highly 
flexible. as the message can 
be adjusted. 
4. It  reaches  masses,  i.e.,  a  large 
number     of     people     can     be 
approached. 
Only  a  limited  number  of 
people   can   be   contacted 
because  of  time  and  cost 
considerations. 
5. In advertising the cost per person 
reached is very low.  
The cost per person is quite 
high in the case of personal 
selling.  
6. Advertising  can  cover  the  market 
in a short time.  
Personal selling efforts take 
a  lot  of  time  to  cover  the 
entire market.  
7. Advertising  makes  use  of  mass 
media    such    television,    radio, 
newspaper, and magazines.  
Personal selling makes use 
of   sales   staff,   which   has 
limited reach. 
1X4=4 

6 
8. Advertising  lacks direct  feedback. 
Marketing   research   efforts   are 
needed   to   judge   customers’ 
reactions to advertising 
Personal   selling   provides 
direct and immediate 
feedback.    Sales    persons 
come   to   know   about   the 
customers’ reactions 
immediately 
9. Advertising   is   more   useful   in 
creating  and  building  interest  of 
the    consumers    in    the    firm's 
products.  
Personal   selling   plays   an 
important role at the 
awareness stage of decision 
making. 
10. Advertising   is   more   useful   in 
marketing to the ultimate 
consumers    who    are    large    in 
numbers. 
Personal   selling   is   more 
useful  in  selling products  to 
the industrial  buyers  or  to 
intermediaries such as 
dealers  and   retailers   who 
are relatively few in number.

has  to  report  to  the 
top management. 
Easier, autonomy as well as 
the    chance    to    perform 
multiple  functions  helps  in

(V) Cost Functions    are    not 
duplicated hence 
economical. 
Duplication  of  resources  in 
various  departments,  hence 
costly. 
(VI) Coordination Difficult for a 
multiproduct 
company 
Easy,  because  all  functions 
related     to     a     particular 
product are integrated in one 
department. 
 OR 
SIGNIFICANCE OF DELEGATION: 
(i) Effective management: By empowering the employees, the managers are 
able  to  function  more  efficiently  as  they  get  more  time  to  concentrate  on 
important matters.  
(ii) Employee development: As a result of delegation, employees get more 
opportunities to utilise their talent and this may give rise to latent abilities in 
them.  It makes them better leaders and decision makers. 
(iii)  Motivation  of  employees: Delegation  helps  in  developing  the  talents  of 
the  employees.  It  also  has  psychological  benefits.  Responsibility  for  work 
build the self-esteem of an employee and improves his confidence.  
(iv)   Facilitation   of   growth: Delegation   helps   in   the   expansion   of   an 
organisation by providing a ready workforce to take up leading positions in 
new ventures.  
(v)  Basis  of  management  hierarchy:  Delegation  of  authority  establishes 
superior-subordinate  relationships,  which  are  the  basis  of  hierarchy  of 
management.  
(vi)  Better  coordination: The  elements  of  delegation  help  to  define  the 
powers,  duties  and  answerability  related  to  the  various  positions  in  an 
organisation.  This  helps  to  avoid  overlapping  of  duties  and  duplication  of 
work.

33. Various techniques used by Leena to improve the performance of her 
employees: 
Method Study-The objective of method study is to find out one best way of 
doing the job. To determine the best way there are several parameters.  
Right from procurement of raw materials till the final product is delivered to 
the  customer  every  activity  is  part  of  method  study.  Taylor  devised  the 
concept of assembly line by using method study. The objective  is to minimise 
the  cost  of  production  and  maximise  the  quality  and  satisfaction  of  the 
customer. 
Time Study-It determines the standard time taken to perform a    well-defined 
job.  The  standard  time  is  fixed  for  the  whole  of  the  task  by  taking  several

readings. The method of time study will depend upon volume and frequency 
of the task, the cycle time of the operation and time measurement costs. 
The  objective  of  time  study  is  to  determine  the  number  of  workers  to  be 
employed; frame suitable incentive schemes and determine labour costs. 
34. (A) Following are the four elements of marketing mix: 
1. PRODUCT: Product means goods or services or ‘anything of value’, 
which is offered to the market for sale. The concept of product relates to 
not  only  the  physical  product    but  also  the  benefits  offered  by  it  from 
customer’s view point. It also includes the extended product or what is 
offered  to  the  customers  by  way  of  after  sales  services,  handling 
complaints, availability   of   spare   parts   etc.The   important   product 
decisions  include  deciding  about  the  features,  quality,  packaging, 
labelling and branding of the products. 
2. PRICE: Price is the amount of money customers have to pay to obtain 
the product. In the case of most of the products, the level of price affects 
the level of their demand. The marketers have not only to decide about 
the objectives of price setting but to analyse the factors determining the 
price and fix a price for the firm’s products. Decisions have also to be 
taken in respect of discounts to customers, traders and credit terms, etc., 
so that customers perceive the price to be in line with the value of the 
product. 
3. PLACE: Place  or  Physical  Distribution  include  activities  that  make  a 
firm's  products  available  to  the  target  customers.  Important  decision 
areas  in  this  respect  include  selection  of  dealers  or  intermediaries  to 
reach the customers, providing support to the intermediaries (by way of 
discounts, promotional campaigns, etc.). The other decision areas relate 
to managing inventory, storage and warehousing and transportation of 
the goods from the place it is produced to the place it is required by the 
buyers. 
4. PROMOTION: Promotion of products and services include activities that 
communicate  availability,  features,  merits,  etc.,  of  the  products  to  the 
target   customers   and   persuade   them   to   buy   it. Most   marketing 
organisations  use  a  number  of  tools  such  as  advertising,  personal 
selling  and  sales  promotion  techniques  like  price  discounts,  free 
coupons etc.

OR 
 Factors affecting price of a product: (any four) 
1. Product Cost: One of the most important factors affecting the price of a 
product or service is its cost. This includes the cost of producing, distributing 
and selling the product. The cost sets the minimum level or the floor price at 
which the product may be sold.In the long run, a firm cannot survive unless 
at least all its costs are covered. There are broadly three types of costs: viz 
Fixed Costs, Variable Costs and Semi Variable Costs. 
2. The utility and demand: While the product costs set the lower limits of 
the price, the utility provided by the product and the intensity of demand of 
the buyer sets the upper limit of price, which a buyer would be prepared to 
pay. The buyer may be ready to pay up to the point where the utility from the 
product is at least equal to the sacrifice made in terms of the price paid.

3. Extent  of  competition  in  the  market: The  price  will  tend  to  reach  the 
upper  limit  in  case  there  is  lesser  degree  of  competition  while  under 
conditions of free competition, the price will tend to be set at the lowest level. 
4. Government  and  legal  regulations: In  order  to  protect  the  interest  of 
public  against  unfair  practices  in  the  field  of  price  fixing,  Government  can 
intervene and declare a product as essential product and regulate it’s price. 
In such a case, the Government does not allow the firms to charge such a 
high price and intervene to regulate the price of the product. 
5. Pricing objectives: Apart from profit maximisation, the pricing objectives 
of  a  firm  may  include:  (a)  Obtaining  Market  Share  Leadership:  If  a  firm's 
objective is to obtain larger share of the market; it will keep the price of its 
products  at  lower  levels  so  that  greater  number  of  people  are  attracted  to 
purchase  the  products;  (b)  Surviving  in  a  Competitive  Market:  If  a  firm  is 
facing difficulties in surviving in the market because of intense competition or 
introduction  of  a  more  efficient  substitute  by  a competitor,  it  may  resort  to 
discounting  its  products  or  running  a  promotion  campaign  to  liquidate  its 
stock;  and  (c)  Attaining  Product  Quality  Leadership:  In  this  case,  normally 
higher prices are charged to cover high quality and high cost of research and 
Development. 
6. Marketing Methods Used: Price fixation process is also affected by other 
elements  of  marketing  such  as  distribution  system,  quality  of  salesmen 
employed,  quality  and  amount  of  advertising,  sales  promotion  efforts,  the 
type  of  packaging,  product  differentiation,  credit  facility  and  customer 
services provided.
