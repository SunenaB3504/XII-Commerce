Limitations of using internal sources of recruitment are as follows:  
1. When  vacancies  are  filled  through  internal  promotions,  the 
scope for induction of fresh talent is reduced. Hence, complete 
reliance on internal recruitment involves danger of ‘inbreeding’ 
by stopping ‘infusion of new blood’ into the organization. 
2. The employees may become lethargic if they are sure of time 
bound promotions; 
3. A new enterprise cannot use internal sources of recruitment. 
No organisation can fill all its vacancies from internal sources;  
4. The  spirit  of  competition  among  the  employees  may  be 
hampered; and 
5. Frequent  transfers  of  employees  may  often  reduce  the 
productivity of the organisation. 
OR                                             OR 
Commonly used sources of recruiting the employees from outside the 
organization (any 4) 
Direct  recruitment-  A  notice  is  placed  on  the  notice  board  of  the 
enterprise specifying the details of the jobs available. Job-seekers 
assemble outside the premises of the organisation on the specified 
date and selection is done on the spot. It is suitable for filling casual 
vacancies  when there is a rush of work or when some permanent 
workers are absent.  
Casual  Callers  - Many  reputed  business  organizations  keep  a 
database of unsolicited applicants in their offices. A list of such job-
seekers can be prepared and can be screened to fill the vacancies 
as they arise. Most  of  the senior positions of industry as well as 
commerce are filled by this method. The advantage of advertising 
vacancies is that more information about the organization and job 
can be given in the advertisement.              . 
Employment exchange- Employment exchange run by a government

Taxation policy: If tax on dividend is higher, it is better to pay less by 
way of dividends. Though dividends are free of tax in the hands of 
shareholders, a dividend distribution tax is levied on companies. Under 
the present tax policy, shareholders are likely to prefer higher 
dividends. 
Cash flow position: The payment of dividend involves an outflow of 
cash. Availability of enough cash in the company is necessary for 
declaration of dividend.

30 Mr Aariketh Acharya has suggested capital budgeting decision.  
Reasons why he must have advised this decision are: 
1.  These decisions have bearing on the long-term growth. They 
affect the future prospects of the business. 
2.  These decisions result in large portion of funds being blocked 
in long term projects, these investments are planned after a 
detailed analysis. 
3.  These  decisions  affect  the  returns  of  the  firm,  therefore 
influence the overall business risk complexion of the firm. 
4.  These  decisions  once  taken,  are  not  reversible  without 
incurring  heavy  losses.  Abandoning  a  project  after  heavy 
investment is costly in terms of waste of funds.

a)  Method Study: The objective of method study is to find out one 
best way of doing the job. There are various methods of doing 
the  job.  To  determine  the  best  way  there  are  several 
parameters. Right from procurement of raw materials till the 
final product is delivered to the customer every activity is part 
of  method  study.  The  objective  of  the  whole  exercise  is  to 
minimise the cost of production and maximise the quality and 
satisfaction  of  the  customer.  For  this  purpose,  many 
techniques like process charts and operations research etc., 
are used. 
b)  Motion Study: Motion study refers to the study of movements 
like lifting, putting objects, sitting and changing positions etc., 
which are undertaken while doing a typical job. Unnecessary 
movements are sought to be eliminated so that it takes less 
time to complete the job efficiently. On close examination of 
body motions, for example, it is possible to find out: (i) Motions 
which  are  productive  (ii)  Motions  which  are  incidental  (e.g., 
going to stores) (iii) Motions which are unproductive.  
c)  Time Study: It determines the standard time taken to perform a 
well-defined job. Time measuring devices are used for each 
element of task. The standard time is fixed for the whole of the 
task by taking several readings. The method of time study will 
depend upon volume and frequency of the task, the cycle time 
of the operation and time measurement costs. The objective of 
time  study  is  to  determine  the  number  of  workers  to  be 
employed;  frame  suitable  incentive  schemes  and  determine 
labour costs.

a.  Discipline: Discipline is the obedience to organisational rules 
and  employment  agreement  which  are  necessary  for  the 
working  of  the  organisation.  According  to  Fayol,  discipline 
requires good superiors at all levels, clear and fair agreements 
and judicious application of penalties. 
b.  Order: According to Fayol, “People and materials must be in 
suitable  places  at  appropriate  time  for  maximum  efficiency.” 
The  principle  of  order  states  that  ‘A  place  for  everything 
(everyone) and everything (everyone) in its (her/his) place’.If 
there is a fixed place for everything and it is present there, then 
there will be no hindrance in the activities of business/ factory. 
This will lead to increased productivity and efficiency. 
c.  Initative: Workers should be encouraged to develop and carry 
out their plans for improvements according to Fayol. Initiative 
means taking the first step with self-motivation. It is thinking out 
and executing the plan. Initiative should be encouraged. But it 
does not mean going against the established practices of the 
company  for  the  sake  of  being  different.  A  good  company 
should  have  an  employee  suggestion  system  whereby 
initiative/  suggestions  which  result  in  substantial  cost/time 
reduction should be rewarded.

32 Steps in planning process 
1.  Setting  objectives:  Objectives  or  goals  specify  what  the 
organisation  wants  to  achieve.  They  give  direction  to  all 
departments and must be stated clearly. They may be set for 
the  entire  organisation  and  each  department  within  the 
organisation 
2.  Developing premises: Planning is concerned with future which 
is  uncertain,  therefore  manager  has  to  make  certain 
assumptions about future. Assumptions are base material upon 
which plans are drawn which may be in the form of forecasts, 
existing plans or past information about policies. 
3.  Identifying alternative courses of action: Once objectives are 
set  and  assumptions  are  made,  next  step  is  to  identify 
alternative  courses  of  action.  The  course  of  action  may  be 
routine or innovative. An innovative course may be adopted by 
involving more people and sharing their ideas. 
                        OR 
1) Planning reduces overlapping and wasteful activities 
Planning serves as a basis of coordinating the activities and efforts of 
different divisions, departments and sections. Since planning ensures 
clarity  in  thought  and  action,  work  is  carried  out  smoothly  without 
interruptions. 
 2) Planning establishes standards of controlling 
Planning  provides  the  goals  against  which  actual  performance  is 
measured. Through comparison, managers can know whether they 
are  actually  able  to  achieve  the  goals.  Deviations,  if  any  can  be 
corrected. Thus planning is a prerequisite for controlling. The nature 
of  deviations  depends  upon  the  extent  of  deviations  from  the 
standard.  
3) Planning facilitates decision making 
Planning helps managers to look into the future and make a choice 
from amongst various alternative courses of action. The manager has 
to evaluate each alternate and select the most viable proposition.

a)   The function of marketing that enables the marketer to achieve 
its goals is Transportation. 
It involves physical movement of goods from one place to another. 
Since  the  user  of  products  are  wide  spread  and  geographically 
separated from the place where they are produced it is necessary to 
move them to the place where they are needed for consumption. 
b)The factors that should be taken into consideration to analyse the 
marketing needs are nature of the product, cost and location of target 
market. 
c) The function of marketing that reduces the gap between production 
and consumption of paddy is Storage or Warehousing. 
Due to irregular demand or supply, there may be time gap between 
production of goods and their sale. Storage helps in reducing the time 
gap between production and consumption and provides time utility. 
Importance of warehousing: 
1.  To ensure smooth flow of products in the market 
2.  To protect against any unavoidable delays in delivery or meet 
contingencies in demand.

a)  The  organisational  structure  adopted  by  Diligent  Developers  is 
Functional structure . Functional structure is an organisational design 
that groups similar or related jobs together. 
b) Benefits of functional structure: 
1) It leads to occupational specialization since emphasis is placed on 
specific functions.This promotes efficiency in utilization of manpower 
as employees perform similar tasks within a department and are able 
to improve performance. 
2) It promotes control and coordination within a department because of 
similarity in the tasks being performed. 
Limitations of functional structure: 
(a) A functional structure places less emphasis on overall enterprise 
objectives  than  the  objectives  pursued  by  a  functional  head.  Such 
practices may lead to functional empires wherein the importance of a 
particular  function  may  be  overemphasised.  Pursuing  departmental 
interests  at  the  cost  of  organisational  interests  can  also  hinder  the 
interaction between two or more departments.  
(b) It may lead to problems in coordination as information has to be 
exchanged across functionally differentiated departments
